About
=====
I have nothing to say.
You may want to install ack and ctags. Also ruby.
Git, of course.
Oh, and there's no need to checkout to gh-pages branch.
Seriously, it will ruin submodules.

TODO:
=====
* properly comment vimrc
* make uninstall script (?)
* make install script more awesome (though I need learn shell scripting first)
* make install script for <del>losers</del> Windows
