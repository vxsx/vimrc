About
=====
I have nothing to say.
You may want to install ack and ctags. Also ruby.
Git, of course.
Oh, and there's no need to checkout to gh-pages branch.
Seriously.

TODO:
=====
* properly comment vimrc
* make uninstall script, possibly an upgrade script
* make install script more awesome (thought I need learn shell scripting
  first)
